# 📝 Journal Web Application (Work in Progress)

This is a simple personal journal website that allows users to log and reflect on their daily moods and thoughts. Built using **Flask** for the backend and a custom-designed frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is my first step into full-stack web development.

> 🚀 Currently in development as part of my self-learning journey.
