# 📝 Journal Web Application (Work in Progress)

This is a simple personal journal website that allows users to log and reflect on their daily moods and thoughts. I contributed to the **backend development** of this project using **Flask**, handling routing, data storage, and server-side logic.

> 🚀 This project is a self-learning initiative and is still under development.

## 🌟 Backend Features I Implemented

* Flask routes for homepage, adding, viewing, and deleting journal entries
* Form handling using POST and GET methods
* File-based storage (`entries.txt`) to store journal entries
* Dynamic rendering using Jinja2 templates
* Logic to delete entries based on their position in the file

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Backend)

* **Language**: Python
* **Framework**: Flask
* **Templating**: Jinja2
* **Data Storage**: Plain text file (`entries.txt`)

---

## 🎯 Future Plans

* Replace text file with database storage (SQLite or MongoDB)
* Add authentication (login/logout)
* Implement input validation and error handling
* Work with a frontend developer to enhance UI integration
* Deploy using a full-stack platform (e.g., Render or Replit)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

* Flask app structure and routing
* Handling HTML form data securely
* Reading/writing files in Python
* Connecting backend logic to frontend templates
* Debugging and iterative development
